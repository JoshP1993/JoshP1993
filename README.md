## Hello there 
I’m Josh 👋

I’m a Digital Excellence and Transformation Consultant with a background in change, strategy, behavioural science, and AI-enabled learning.

I work on:
- digital adoption and organisational change
- AI-enabled products and services
- learning, capability building, and transformation
- making complex technology usable, human, and valuable

## Why I’m on GitHub
I’m always looking to be building hands-on technical literacy to complement my strategic and change background.

This space is where I:
- learn how modern software and AI products are built
- explore open-source tools and patterns
- document learning 
- bridge the gap between technical teams and business outcomes

## What you’ll find here
- Learning repos and notes as I build confidence with Git, GitHub, and code
- Small experiments and prototypes
- Reflections on AI, automation, and digital product thinking

## Current focus
- Applied AI and LLM-enabled products
- Digital adoption and capability building
- AI literacy for non-technical leaders
- Responsible, human-centred use of emerging technology
